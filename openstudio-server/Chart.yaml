description: A Helm chart for Kubernetes

# A chart can be either an 'application' or a 'library' chart.
#
# Application charts are a collection of templates that can be packaged into versioned archives
# to be deployed.
#
# Library charts provide useful utilities or functions for the chart developer. They're included as
# a dependency of application charts to inject those utilities and functions into the rendering
# pipeline. Library charts do not define any templates and therefore cannot be deployed.
type: application

# This is the chart version. This version number should be incremented each time you make changes
# to the chart and its templates, including the app version.
version: 0.3.0

# This is the version number of the application being deployed. This version number should be
# incremented each time you make changes to the application.
appVersion: 3.3.0

# This is an offical helm chart: https://github.com/helm/charts/tree/master/stable/nfs-server-provisioner
# openstudio-sever modfied this slighly to use deployment vs stateful sets as helm does not automatically 
# remote peristent volumes using stateful sets even though they are labled as "Delete". However, Using Deployment 
# together with a PVC, helm does indeed remove the PV upon a helm delete command
